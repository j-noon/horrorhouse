# About Horror House
  welcome to Horror House. Horror House is a very small click puzzle game. It's idea is to engage with the user to have them think and actually pay atention to the page. If they are able to decipher my small puzzles they will eventually get to the end and be able to find the token to escape the room's.  The idea is to be slightly educational and to hint and show small tips within the cyber security field for what and how pentesters go about their day to day tests and exploits.

# Purpose of Horror House
Horror Houese's main purpose is for educational gain. By leaving clues on what to do and where to press it will demostrate examples of pentesting techniques that are used day to day in the field of a pentester. With the clues getting less and less helpful, and the puzzles getting harder, it will force the users to then go and search or read up about the technique thats being hinted upon, for them to then return to the game to then finally be able to complete the game by escaping the rooms.   

# Features
